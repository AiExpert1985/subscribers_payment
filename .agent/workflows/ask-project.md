## Scope (Read-Only)

You MUST NOT modify files or trigger workflows.

---

## Information Sources

### 1. Start with Summaries (default)
- `/obelisk/contracts/contracts-summary.md`
- `/obelisk/design/design-summary.md`

Use for most questions about current state.

---

### 2. Read Logs When Needed
- `/obelisk/contracts/contracts-log.md`
- `/obelisk/design/design-log.md`
- `/obelisk/history/history-log.md`

Use when:
- Question asks about evolution or rationale
- Summary is insufficient

---

### 3. Read Code When Needed
Use only if question concerns current implementation or feature existence.

---

### 4. Read Archive When Needed
Use only if question references a specific task or rejection.

---

## Rules

- Base answers on canonical records.
- Prefer summaries; consult logs only when necessary.
- Cite sources (file + section/date/task).
- If information is not found, state so explicitly.
- Do not speculate.

## Output Format
